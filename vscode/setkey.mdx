## Setting Your API Key

First, [get your API key](/vscode/getkey) if you haven't already.

Then, follow these steps to set it up in VS Code:

1. Open the Command Palette:
   - Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Mac: Press `Cmd+Shift+P`

2. Type "ascend: API key" and select "ðŸš€ Ascend: API key" from the suggestions

3. Paste your API key in the input box that appears and press Enter

Once set, the extension will automatically connect to your Ascend account and start tracking your coding sessions.

If you need to update your API key later, you can follow the same steps to enter a new key.

## Verifying the Connection

After setting your API key, you should see your Ascend status in the VS Code status bar. If the connection is successful, you'll see your current challenge progress and time tracked. If you haven't joined any challenges yet, you'll see "No active challenge" - head over to the [Ascend app](https://app.ascend.sh) to join your first challenge!

If you encounter any issues, try:
1. Checking that you've copied the API key correctly
2. Restarting VS Code
