To connect the VS Code extension with your Ascend account, you'll need an API key. Here's how to get one:

1. Log in to [Ascend](https://app.ascend.sh)
2. Click on your profile picture in the top left corner
3. Under API key, click on the copy icon to copy it

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If your key is compromised, you can revoke it and generate a new one from the same place.
</Warning>

Once you have your API key, you'll need to [set it up in VS Code](/vscode/setkey) to start tracking your coding sessions.
